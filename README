git-locate
==========

A search tool to answer the age-old question: "Where my gits at?"

* You may have several machines in use at any given time,
  with subsets of all repos sparsely scattered across.
* Same repo's replica directories may end-up named differently.
* You may end-up missing a local copy of an Internet-hosted replica.
* You may have orphaned local repos (with no remotes)
* You can end-up with any combination of the above scenarios!

### So, how to be sure everything is in sync?

1. Find all the repos and confirm what is a fork of what (sharing an ancestor);
2. Compare their status to understand what is out of date;
3. Decide what should be pruned, moved, updated or whatever.

`git-locate` is mainly motivated by 1, but also aims to be useful for 2.
